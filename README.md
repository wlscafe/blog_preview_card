## My process

  I started out laying out the HTML so I could use Flexbox. I have been learning about Flexbox and wanted to use it.
  I tried to use Semantic HTML and keep the context of a webpage.
  Once I had the HTML I started on the CSS. After I thought I was finished styling the card I noticed that the image illustration-article.svg would not center the full width. So I started over again.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
-

### What I learned
